# TCC - Undergraduate Thesis

#### This project was developed in group as a final undergraduation project.
#### Its main purpose was to create a software that shows it's possible to use Kinect to raise body awareness on work environments.
#### It was developed using C# and the kinect SDK V1 (because we used the kinect for XBOX and not the one for computer, so the SDK v2 was not compatible)
#### This software is a game with 2 phases: 
####### Phase 1: Choose the posture pairs (wrong and right) using one hand
####### Phase 2: This time the game will show the player Yoga postures that they will have specified time to copy. The game will evaluate the main joints to define whether it's wrong or right.
